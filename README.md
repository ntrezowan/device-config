This Brewfile installs all the necessary packages (according to me) required after getting a freshly installed MacOS.

1. Install Homebrew;
    ```bash
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
  
2. Install Bundle;
    ```bash
    brew tap Homebrew/bundle
    ```
